## Dashboards (what they show + how to use them)

How to use it (daily routine):

- **Business-specific KPIs** (leads, conversion rate, revenue, active campaigns)
- A **Business Tools** grid (the operational tools for that business)
- Helpful tooltips explaining what each tool is for

How to use it (daily routine):
1. Look at KPIs to spot issues (conversion drop, lead spike, etc.).
2. Open the relevant tool:
	 - New leads → CRM Pipeline
	 - Many inbound messages → Unified Inbox

## Tool-by-tool guide (what each tool does + how it’s used)

### Unified Inbox (all messages in one place)
Purpose: prevent customer messages and lead conversations from getting lost.

What it includes:

- A channel view showing sources such as **Email**, **Instagram**, **Facebook**, **LinkedIn**
- Message list + a message detail panel

How teams use it:
1. Start the day in **Inbox** and filter for unread.
2. Star high-priority leads for follow-up.
3. Reply and then archive when the conversation is “handled.”
4. Use tags to keep a lightweight workflow (e.g., “proposal”, “partnership”).

Purpose: plan social posts, keep a consistent publishing rhythm, and track impact.

Key capabilities you’ll notice:

	- **Individual Platforms** (platform-by-platform stats)

How teams use it:

2. Add scheduled posts into the campaign.
3. Use analytics to learn which platform drives the best engagement.
4. Adjust posting frequency and content style based on results.

What it covers:
- **Campaigns** with statuses like draft, scheduled, sent
- Campaign performance basics (sent, delivered, opened, clicked, bounced)
- Revenue attribution for campaigns (where applicable)
- **Automated sequences** (multi-step follow-ups triggered by events)

How to use campaigns (broadcast email):
1. Create a campaign (name, subject, sender details, message).
2. Choose whether to keep it as a draft, schedule it, or send.
3. After sending, review opens/clicks and iterate your messaging.

How to use sequences (automation):
1. Create a sequence.
2. Choose a trigger (examples: form submission, inactivity).
3. Define the steps (e.g., welcome email → follow-up → final check-in).
4. Track enrolled vs. completed leads.

---

### Lead CRM Pipeline (lead management + follow-up discipline)
Purpose: give a clear workflow for converting leads, and keep accountability.

What it includes:
- Two primary ways to view leads:
	- **List view** (table-style management)
	- **Pipeline view** (stage-based flow)
- Stages that represent the real sales journey (examples include New, Contacted, Engaged, Qualified, Opportunity, Converted)
- Filters and search to find the right lead quickly
- Campaign grouping (view leads by source/campaign such as Website Forms, Email, Social, Paid Ads, Referral)
- Conversion workflow that captures deal value when marking a lead as **Converted**
- Follow-up timing tracking for new leads (helps highlight “overdue follow-ups”)

How a sales rep uses it (daily):
1. Open the pipeline and focus first on **New** leads.
2. Contact them and move them to **Contacted**.
3. Track intent: move to **Engaged** when they respond/click.
4. Move to **Qualified** once they meet criteria.
5. When the lead becomes a customer, mark as **Converted** and record deal value.

How a manager uses it (weekly):
1. Check how many leads are stuck in early stages.
2. Review follow-up discipline (late vs on-time).
3. Look at conversion and deal values to understand pipeline health.

---

### Brand Kit & AI Persona (brand consistency)
Purpose: keep marketing consistent and “on brand,” even across multiple team members.

What you can define:

2. Fix critical issues first (highest impact).
3. Work through warnings and quick wins.

### Lead Forms (build, embed, track, and improve)
Purpose: create lead-capture forms that you can embed or share—then track performance.

What forms support:
- Single-step or multi-step forms
- Drag-and-drop style field selection (text, email, phone, dropdowns, etc.)
- Visual theming (colors, font feel, header styling)
- Submit behaviors:
	- show a success message
	- show a custom message
	- redirect to another page
- “Lead quality helpers”:
	- duplicate detection
	- automatic scoring
	- follow-up threshold (flag leads not contacted within a set time)
- Campaign tracking configuration (marketing-friendly tracking like traffic source, channel, campaign name)

How teams use Lead Forms (step-by-step):
1. Create a form (name + type).
2. Add questions/fields.
3. Configure what happens after submission (message or redirect).
4. Customize the theme to match the brand.
5. Embed it on a website or share the hosted link.
6. Track performance:
	 - views vs submissions
	 - conversion rate
	 - average completion time
	 - device breakdown
	 - drop-off for multi-step forms

Why tracking matters:
If views are high but submissions are low, it usually means the form is too long, unclear, or not trusted—so you simplify or clarify.

How teams use it:

	- Warm (60–79)
